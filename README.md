# shopping_list_ui

A new Flutter project.

This repo contains the UI (created using flutter) of a random UI design of a shopping list I saw on dribble. I tried to recreate using the assets I could lay my hands on 😁

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
